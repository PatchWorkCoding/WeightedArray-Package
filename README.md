### Purpose:
An easy way to create weighted tables for randomized selection that can be easily edited in the unity inpector

### Requirements:
when adding the weighted array to your code you must be include:
- **1.** ```using PatchworkCoding.WeightedArray;```
- **2.** "Validate()" method of the weighted array to your script's ```void OnValidate()```

### Methods:
- **1.** ```GetElement()``` Gets a random element from the array with consideration to its weight
- **2.** ```GetElementAtIndex(int i)``` Gets an element at "i" index of the array

### Misc:
If you need help or the package ends up breaking you can get in touch via email at [admin@roseott.dev](admin@roseott.dev) or through twitter [@patchworkcoding](https://twitter.com/patchworkcoding).
